Work experience
* **[Blueberry Breeding & Genomics Lab](https://www.blueberrybreeding.com/)**
	* 2018-actual, Graduate Research Assistant, PI Prof Dr Patricio Muñoz, University of Florida.
* **[Statistical-Genetics Lab](http://statgen.esalq.usp.br)**
	* 2016-2018, Graduate Research Assistant, PI Prof Dr Augusto Garcia, University of São Paulo
	* Scholarship provided by CNPq/Brazil. Has worked in several projects as: linkage mapping in autotetraploidy, linkage mapping for a multi-family population, QTL mapping, pairwise relatedness inference in autopolyploids, and software development. Also was the Lab's network administrator.
* **[Statistical-Genetics Lab](http://statgen.esalq.usp.br)**
	* 2010-2015, Scientific Initiation, PI Prof Augusto Garcia, University of São Paulo
	* With two scientific initiation scholarships in the period funded by Santander and PIBIC/CNPq. Worked with analysis of the population structure in a Sugarcane data, development of a bioinformatic pipeline to do automatic SNP calling in autopolyploids, and development of a software which builds relationship matrices considering ploidy level.
* **Forage Breeding and Genomics Lab**
	* 10 months in 2014, Internship, PI Prof Dr Patricio Muñoz, University of Florida
	* Supported the breeding program in daily activities as crop management, plant phenotyping, and data analysis. Also contributed with phenotyping and data analysis in a partnership with the Blueberry Breeding Program during the period.
